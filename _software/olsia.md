title: OLSIA
description: "OLSIA (Open Lumber Spine Image Analysis) is a 3D Slicer extension designed for automated lumbar spine analysis. It segments vertebral bodies (L1-S1) and intervertebral discs (L1/L2-L5/S1), and automatically grades disc degeneration using the Pfirrmann scale. OLSIA also features a batch processing mode for DICOM images, generating individual segmentation masks and a consolidated CSV file containing participant information, Pfirrmann grades, and disc height index measurements."
